# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Data Structures and Algorithms Repository! This repository contains various data structure implementations and algorithms in C++.

## Data Structures

### 1. Sorting Algorithms
- `Insertion Sort.cpp`: Implements sorting algorithms like bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quicksort.

### 2. Searching Algorithms
- `Searching.cpp`: Implements searching algorithms like linear search, binary search, and interpolation search.

### 3. Heap
- `Heap.cpp`: Implements a binary heap data structure.
  - `insert`: Adds an element to the heap.
  - `remove`: Removes an element from the heap.
  - `heapify`: Converts an array into a heap.

### 4. Graphs
- `Graphs.cpp`: Implements graph data structures and algorithms.
  - `Graph`: Represents a graph using adjacency list or matrix.
  - `BFS`: Implements Breadth-First Search.
  - `DFS`: Implements Depth-First Search.
  - `TopologicalSort`: Implements topological sorting.

### 5. Hashing
- `Hashing.cpp`: Implements hash tables using various collision resolution techniques like chaining and probing.

### 6. Backtracking and Recursion
- `NQueen.cpp`: Includes algorithms using backtracking like N-Queens.
- `Recursion.cpp`: Demonstrates recursive algorithms and their applications.

### 7. Linked Lists
- `Singly Linked.cpp`: Implements singly linked lists.
  - `insert`: Inserts a node into the linked list.
  - `delete`: Deletes a node from the linked list.
  - `search`: Searches for a node in the linked list.

### 8. Stacks and Queues
- `stack.cpp`: Implements a stack data structure.
- `queue.cpp`: Implements a queue data structure.

### 9. Trees
- `Binary_search_tree.cpp`: Implements a binary search tree.
- `Avl_tree.cpp`: Implements an AVL tree for balanced binary search trees.
